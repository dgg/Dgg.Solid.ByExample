If for each object _o1_ of type _**S**_ there is an
object _o2_ of type _**T**_ such that for all
programs **P** defined in terms of _**T**_,
the behavior of **P** is unchanged when _o1_ is substituted
for _o2_ then _**S**_ is a subtype of _**T**_

---

derivatives must be sustitutives for their base types

Subclasses must live up to the expectations set for their parents
